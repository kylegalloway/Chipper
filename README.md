# Chipper

## About

Most of the logic and things were borrowed or learned from https://github.com/mikezaby/chip-8.rs.

I updated everything so that it compiles with rust 1.28.

I also changed some things to suit my thoughts or use new rust functionality (overflow logic).

Lastly, I converted it to use sdl2 instead of sdl.

## Requirements

* Rust
* sdl2 library

## Usage Instructions

```sh
cargo build

cargo run <program>
```
